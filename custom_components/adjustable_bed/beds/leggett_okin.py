"""Leggett & Platt Okin variant bed controller implementation.

Reverse engineering by MarcusW and Richard Hopton (smartbed-mqtt).

This controller handles Leggett & Platt beds using the Okin binary protocol.

Protocol details:
    Service UUID: 62741523-52f9-8864-b1ab-3b3a8d65950b (shared with Okimat/Nectar)
    Write characteristic: 62741525-52f9-8864-b1ab-3b3a8d65950b
    Command format: 6-byte binary [0x04, 0x02, <4-byte-command-big-endian>]
    Motor timing: held keycodes stream every 100ms, released with four zero frames
    Position feedback: Not supported
    Pairing: Required before first use; handled by coordinator

Note: This shares the same BLE service UUID with Okimat and Nectar beds.
Detection uses device name patterns ("leggett", "l&p", "lp bed") to distinguish
between these bed types. See okin_protocol.py for the shared binary protocol
specification.
