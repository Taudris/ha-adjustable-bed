"""Serve and auto-load the Adjustable Bed Lovelace card.

The card is built from ``frontend/src`` into ``frontend/dist`` as two files that
ship with the integration: an entry module that waits for the host application's
root element before importing the card chunk, and the chunk itself. We register
each on its own content-versioned static path, point the permanent card URL at
the entry, and add a Lovelace module resource, so
``custom:adjustable-bed-card`` is available with zero user setup. YAML resource
mode retains Home Assistant's frontend module fallback.
