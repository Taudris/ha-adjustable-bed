Canonical APK Protocol Audit clean-room analyst prompt (issue #443).

Copy this file into a run's input/ directory unchanged and fill only the <<...>> placeholders.
Do not hand-edit a workspace copy: this tracked file is the source of truth, and
tests/test_cleanroom_guard.py checks that its schema revision matches
docs/apk-analysis/analysis.schema.json.

This prompt is protocol-neutral by construction. It must never name a bed brand, protocol
family, service or characteristic UUID, command byte, or device-name pattern. If one appears
here, that is a repository defect: the analyst would be reading the answer.
-->

ROLE

You are a senior Android and Bluetooth reverse engineer conducting a clean-room,
evidence-first analysis of one Android application. Your job is to recover every
reachable Bluetooth bed-control protocol in the supplied artifact. Work like a
forensic analyst, not a summarizer. Be exhaustive, skeptical, and explicit about
uncertainty. Accuracy is more important than speed.

SCOPE

Analyze only the supplied package and all of its splits. BLE bed control is the
primary target. Also identify Bluetooth Classic, Wi-Fi, cloud, firmware-update,
diagnostic, and unrelated paths, but label them out of scope unless they affect
BLE discovery, authentication, capability selection, or control.

You must discover the protocol from the artifact itself. Do not compare against,
search for, or rely on any Home Assistant code, existing protocol documentation,
prior APK analysis, issue, PR, commit, user report, traffic capture, or analysis
of another app. Do not infer a value from knowledge of a similar bed or protocol.

INPUTS

- App name: <<APP_NAME>>
- Package ID: <<PACKAGE_ID>>
- Expected version name: <<VERSION_NAME>>
- Expected version code: <<VERSION_CODE>>
- Source and lookup date: <<SOURCE_AND_DATE>>
- Expected archive/set SHA-256: <<SET_SHA256>>
  Computed as follows, so you can reproduce it rather than copy it. If the delivery is a single
  archive (one APK or one XAPK), it is that archive's SHA-256. If it is a loose set of files, build
  a manifest with one `<basename> <lowercase hex sha256>` line per supplied file, LF-terminated,
  UTF-8, sorted byte-wise by basename, with no trailing blank line; the set digest is that
  manifest's SHA-256. Record the manifest verbatim in SEARCH_LOG.md. A mismatch between the
  computed and expected digest is an identity failure.
- Expected signer certificate SHA-256: <<SIGNER_SHA256>>
- Supplied files: <<SUPPLIED_FILES>>
- Output directory: "<<WORKSPACE>>"
- Known acquisition limitations: see input/identity.json -> known_acquisition_limitations
- Required analysis.json schema and revision: input/analysis.schema.json, revision phase4-analysis-v1.12-2026-07-26

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

1. Never stop at the first UUID, protocol class, command table, or working code path.
2. Never call a constant a command until you trace it to a reachable BLE write.
3. Never infer packet structure, checksum, byte order, timing, or semantics from a
   name alone. Trace the transformation actually used at the write boundary.
4. Treat decompiler output as a hypothesis. Use resources, smali, disassembly,
   callsites, and multiple independent references to resolve ambiguity.
5. Distinguish app-owned live code from dead code, sample code, third-party SDKs,
   firmware payloads, tests, and unused assets.
6. Distinguish recall from save/program, tap from press-and-hold, movement from
   release/STOP, and global commands from side-specific commands.
7. Preserve exact bytes, signed/unsigned conversions, endianness, masks, offsets,
   encodings, checksums, encryption, and state preconditions.
8. A negative result is not proven by one failed search. Record the searches and
   areas examined before reporting that something was not found.
9. Do not fill gaps with plausible values. Use TENTATIVE for an uncertain claim and
   PARTIAL or BLOCKED for a run that cannot satisfy the completion gates.
10. Do not declare the analysis complete until every completion gate below passes.
11. Your working directory is "<<WORKSPACE>>". Do not read, list, search, or cd into any path
    outside it, apart from the tools you invoke. The integration repository is off-limits in
    full, including its instruction files, documentation, tests, source, and git history.
12. The harness may auto-inject CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md instruction files into your context
    before your first action. Those are process instructions, never evidence. Record every
    injected file in SEARCH_LOG.md, state explicitly that nothing in it was used as evidence,
    and stop with status BLOCKED if any injected file hands over a protocol answer: a service
    or characteristic UUID, a command or packet byte value, a framing or checksum description,
    a device-name matching pattern, or a command repeat/hold interval attributed to a bed
    protocol. That is a repository defect, not an acceptable exposure. An injected file may
    legitimately describe a host integration's own configuration defaults and connection
    timeouts; those are not protocol answers and are not grounds to block, but they are
    equally unusable as evidence.

REQUIRED WORKFLOW

Phase A: Verify and inventory the supplied artifact

1. Recompute hashes and verify package ID, version name/code, signer, minimum/target
   SDK, and every supplied split. Stop and report INPUT_MISMATCH if identity differs.
2. Inventory every DEX file, resource split, asset, native library, JavaScript bundle,
   source map, SWF, Dart/Flutter library, managed assembly, and firmware blob.
3. Identify all application stacks actually present: Java/Kotlin, Flutter/Dart,
   React Native/Hermes, Cordova/WebView JavaScript, Adobe AIR, Xamarin/.NET, Unity,
   JNI/C/C++, or another stack. More than one stack may contain relevant logic.
4. Create a tool-coverage table. For every stack, record the tool and version used,
   success/failure, warnings, and fallback. A stack containing application logic
   cannot be silently skipped.

Complexity checkpoint before Phase B:

5. Count every independently selectable product, model, remote-code, variant, protocol implementation, and configuration branch before deep tracing. Write a stable, sorted variant inventory containing the artifact-local identifier, source path or object identity, selector/mapping evidence, and content hash where practical.
6. Estimate whether the complete inventory can be analyzed within one run. If it cannot, do not sample, truncate, or call a representative variant exhaustive. Partition the inventory deterministically into non-overlapping shards using stable identifiers or sorted ranges. Shards may run sequentially or independently, but each must use the same prompt and schema and must report the exact inventory entries it covers.
   Every shard takes a stable shard ID and writes to its own paths: `work/<SHARD_ID>/` for tool output and `report/<SHARD_ID>/` for `ANALYSIS.md`, `analysis.json`, `SEARCH_LOG.md`, reproducer scripts and `REPORT.SHA256`. Shards must never share an output path, whether they run concurrently or in sequence: overwriting a sibling's report destroys the immutable per-shard evidence that reconciliation depends on. A single-shard run uses `report/` directly. The reconciliation pass writes `report/RECONCILIATION.md` plus its own `analysis.json`, and records each shard's ID, covered inventory entries, and `REPORT.SHA256` hashes.
7. A shared transport may be analyzed once, but every shard must independently trace its product-specific reachability, dynamic selector fields, commands, capabilities, and model mappings. Shared-library constants remain candidates until a variant-specific path proves them reachable.
8. Run a reconciliation pass after all shards. It must prove: total inventory equals analyzed entries plus evidence-backed aliases/duplicates, dead/unreachable entries, and explicitly blocked entries; no entry is missing or counted twice; conflicts between shards are preserved and resolved or marked unresolved.
9. A common-transport report may be PARTIAL while variant shards remain. COMPLETE requires zero unaccounted inventory entries, not merely a recovered shared packet builder. Record the inventory manifest, shard definition, per-shard counts, reconciliation result, and remaining blockers in ANALYSIS.md, analysis.json, and SEARCH_LOG.md.

Phase B: Decompile every relevant execution layer

Start by recording tool versions and running a protocol-neutral baseline. Adapt paths to
the isolated workspace, quote every path, and keep the original artifacts untouched.

Minimum baseline commands:

    aapt dump badging <BASE_APK>
    unzip -l <ARCHIVE_OR_SPLIT>
    jadx --show-bad-code --comments-level info --threads-count 4 -d "<<WORKSPACE>>"/work/jadx <ALL_RELEVANT_APKS>
    apktool d <APK_WITH_FAILED_OR_SUSPICIOUS_CODE> -o "<<WORKSPACE>>"/work/smali/<APK_NAME>
    rg --files "<<WORKSPACE>>" | sort

Run the baseline under an error-capturing wrapper, not a strict-shell sequence that
aborts on the first non-zero status. Record each command's exit status and continue to
inspect any output it created. In particular, jadx commonly returns non-zero when only
some methods fail while still producing a valuable source/resource tree. Treat that as
PARTIAL DECOMPILATION: preserve the tree and log, inventory the failed methods, decide
whether each can affect the protocol, and run targeted smali or stack-specific fallbacks.
Treat it as NO OUTPUT only when the expected tree is absent or unusable. A runner using
`set -e` must temporarily disable it around decompilers, capture the status immediately,
then restore it after the output-presence check and fallback decision.

jadx requirements:

1. Include resources. Do not use --no-res for the authoritative pass. Inspect
   res/values*/strings.xml, arrays.xml, XML layouts, raw resources, manifests, and assets.
   These often contain model tables, remote codes, device-name rules, feature labels,
   UUIDs, or mappings that are absent from obvious code.
2. Always use --show-bad-code. Without it, difficult packet/checksum methods can disappear
   and create a false negative.
3. Preserve the full jadx warning/error output. Inventory every failed method and class,
   then disposition whether it can affect discovery, connection, packets, capabilities,
   timing, or device selection.
4. If names are heavily obfuscated, rerun with --deobf --deobf-min-length 3 in a separate
   output directory so the original and deobfuscated views can be cross-checked.
5. Read surrounding class and caller context, not only matching lines. A field name or
   byte constant is not evidence without its construction and use.
6. Inspect every DEX and relevant split. Do not assume the base APK contains all code or
   resources, and do not silently ignore duplicate-looking implementations.

Fallback and stack-specific requirements:

1. For each relevant failed, truncated, inconsistent, or suspicious jadx method, inspect
   apktool smali. Bytecode is the authority when Java reconstruction is incomplete.
2. For Flutter, find every lib/*/libapp.so and confirm arm64-v8a exists. Run Blutter on
   the arm64 directory/library, then inspect asm/, pp.txt, objs.txt, symbols, platform
   channels, and the Android plugin layer. jadx-only Flutter analysis is invalid. If
   Blutter fails or Dart business logic cannot be recovered, status is PARTIAL or BLOCKED.
3. For React Native/Hermes, locate every JavaScript/Hermes bundle and source map. Decompile
   the shipped Hermes bytecode with an appropriate tool, recover original sources when
   maps permit, and trace the native BLE bridge. Verify recovered sources match the
   shipped bundle rather than trusting stale source-map content.
4. For Cordova/WebView apps, inspect assets/www and every JavaScript bundle, source map,
   Cordova plugin, generated asset, and native bridge. Do not limit jadx analysis to the
   plugin wrapper when packet construction lives in JavaScript.
5. For Adobe AIR, detect Main.swf, air.* metadata, and native extensions. Use FFDec/JPEXS
   to export ActionScript from every relevant SWF/ABC and trace any native extension.
6. For JNI/C/C++ logic, map Java native declarations and RegisterNatives tables to the
   actual functions. Use file, strings, readelf, nm, objdump, and a disassembler as
   needed. Record library, ABI, symbol or virtual address, and cross-references.
7. For Xamarin/.NET, Unity/IL2CPP, or another stack, select and record an appropriate
   decompiler. If no reliable route exists, state the exact blocker rather than treating
   opaque code as unrelated.
8. Examine native libraries and embedded blobs even when the main app is Java/Kotlin.
   Protocol builders, crypto, checksums, parsers, or firmware tables may cross a JNI
   boundary.
9. Keep all stack outputs separate and record the exact command, version, exit status,
   warnings, and fallback in SEARCH_LOG.md. No relevant layer may be silently skipped.

Phase C: Enumerate the complete Bluetooth attack surface

Search code, resources, smali, JavaScript/Dart output, and native strings for both
semantic terms and structural signatures. Include UUID formats, scan filters,
Bluetooth APIs, plugin APIs, characteristic properties, byte arrays, hex encoders,
base64, checksums, timers, press/release handlers, model tables, and localization.

Build an exhaustive candidate ledger containing every:

- BLE and Bluetooth Classic scan/start/stop call
- scan filter, advertised service, manufacturer-data filter, and device-name rule
- connect, disconnect, reconnect, bonding, pairing, PIN, and authentication path
- service/characteristic/descriptor discovery and selection path
- characteristic read, write, write-without-response, notify, and indicate callsite
- CCCD write, MTU request, connection-priority request, and initialization sequence
- packet builder, encoder, checksum, CRC, encryption, compression, or framing helper
- UI/background action that can lead to control data
- protocol interface, implementation, factory, strategy, device-type switch, feature
  flag, remote-code table, model map, and firmware-version branch

Run all of these search passes and record both the queries and result counts:

1. Structural UUID pass:
   - full 128-bit UUID strings in all case and separator forms
   - Bluetooth-base UUID construction from 16-bit or 32-bit values
   - UUID.fromString/fromString, Guid, parseUuid, byte-reversed UUIDs, and UUID arrays
2. Transport API pass:
   - BluetoothGatt, BluetoothGattCharacteristic, BluetoothGattDescriptor, ScanFilter,
     writeCharacteristic, readCharacteristic, setCharacteristicNotification, CCCD,
     write-with-response/no-response, notify, indicate, MTU, bond, pair, and disconnect
   - equivalent APIs in Flutter, React Native, Cordova, AIR, Web Bluetooth, and custom
     native bridges
3. Data-construction pass:
   - new byte arrays, byteArrayOf, Uint8List, ByteBuffer, DataView, Buffer, hex/base64
     encoders, string terminators, bit shifts, masks, XOR, sum, CRC, sequence, nonce,
     encrypt/decrypt, frame, packet, opcode, and command builders
4. Action and lifecycle pass:
   - UI labels and resource keys for all motors, presets, memory save/recall, massage,
     lights, locks, sync, sides, stop, release, and device selection
   - ACTION_DOWN/ACTION_UP/ACTION_CANCEL, touchstart/touchend/pointercancel, long press,
     timers, intervals, delayed handlers, cancellation, pause, destroy, and disconnect
5. Capability and identity pass:
   - capabilities, features, motor count, memory count, model, SKU, remote code, product,
     manufacturer data, device info, firmware version, serial, config, EEPROM, settings,
     and persisted selections
6. File/name pass:
   - enumerate every file whose path contains BLE, Bluetooth, GATT, protocol, command,
     packet, frame, manager, service, remote, controller, device, model, or capability
   - list every class implementing/extending a protocol-like interface and every switch
     or factory that selects among them
7. Logging and diagnostics pass:
   - inspect app-owned log format strings, debug screens, packet dumps, analytics event
     names, and error messages because they often reveal otherwise obfuscated semantics

Use multiple spelling, casing, abbreviation, translated-resource, and regex variations.
Never cap a search at the first N hits. Open the surrounding method/class for each hit.
Feed newly discovered class names, constants, model codes, opcodes, and helper names back
into new searches. Continue until an entire pass yields no unexplained candidates.

For each candidate, mark it REACHABLE, CONDITIONALLY REACHABLE, DEAD/UNUSED,
THIRD-PARTY/UNRELATED, or UNRESOLVED. Prove reachability with a call chain from a
user action, connection callback, background service, or selected device/model to
the actual transport operation. Do not discard a second protocol just because the
first one appears to cover the app's main screen.

Phase D: Reconstruct each distinct protocol independently

Assign a local neutral ID such as P1, P2, and P3. Do not name it after a known
integration protocol. For every protocol and variant, extract:

1. Discovery and selection
   - exact local-name rules, prefixes, suffixes, regexes, case handling, and exclusions
   - advertised service UUIDs, service-data fields, manufacturer IDs/data/masks
   - model, SKU, remote-code, QR-code, firmware, region, or user-selection mapping
   - precedence when several devices or protocol rules match

2. GATT and connection behavior
   - service, read, write, notify/indicate, and descriptor UUIDs
   - whether UUIDs are fixed, discovered by properties, or selected dynamically
   - write type, characteristic properties, CCCD value, MTU, bonding, connection
     priority, delays, retries, reconnect behavior, and required subscription order
   - full initialization, authentication, PIN, key exchange, or handshake sequence
   - exact state that gates normal commands

3. Packet construction
   - byte-level frame layout with offsets, lengths, constants, opcodes, parameters,
     sequence counters, side/device selectors, terminators, and dynamic fields
   - integer width, signedness, byte order, string encoding, escaping, and fragmentation
   - checksum/CRC algorithm with covered byte range, initial value, polynomial,
     reflection, final XOR, truncation, and byte order where applicable
   - encryption/obfuscation and key derivation, including session dependencies
   - protocol-neutral pseudocode that reproduces final transport bytes

4. Commands and semantics
   Trace every action from UI/resource label through all wrappers and transformations
   to the final bytes passed to the transport. Include:
   - head/back, legs/feet, lumbar, neck, tilt, height, combined/all, and side A/B
   - up, down, stop, release, and emergency/global stop
   - flat, zero gravity, anti-snore, TV/lounge, custom presets, and every memory slot
   - memory recall versus save/program, including long-press or confirmation behavior
   - massage zones, intensities, wave/patterns, timers, on/off, and stop
   - lights, brightness/color, sync/couple, child lock, alarm, and other local controls
   - read/query/status commands, device information, and capability requests

   For every command row report: protocol/variant, user action, reachable call chain,
   final bytes or reproducible formula, dynamic fields, target characteristic, write
   type, preconditions, repeat count, interval, press/hold/release behavior, STOP
   behavior, response/notification, and exact evidence references.

   In analysis.json each entry of a protocol's `commands` array carries at least
   `action`, `bytes` (the final bytes or the formula that produces them),
   `characteristic`, `write_type`, `timing`, `release_behavior` and a non-empty
   `evidence` list. The schema rejects a row missing any of them, because a row without
   its destination or release semantics cannot be implemented from later.

5. Notifications and state parsing
   - subscription order and all notification/indication message types
   - frame recognition, buffering, fragmentation, checksum validation, and dispatch
   - byte offsets, masks, endianness, scaling, units, calibration, and invalid values
   - position/angle, motor state, massage/light state, capability, error, firmware,
     battery, lock, and acknowledgement semantics
   - how parsed state affects later commands or variant selection

6. Capability and model logic
   - motor count and physical actuator mapping
   - available presets and memory slots
   - massage zones, levels, patterns, timers, lights, sync, sensors, and locks
   - defaults, persisted settings, remote codes, feature bitmasks, and model overrides
   - brand/model strings only where the artifact maps them to a protocol or capability

7. Timing and lifecycle
   - single-shot versus streamed commands
   - initial delay, repeat interval/count, debounce, throttling, timeout, and retry
   - release/cancellation path and whether STOP is guaranteed
   - foreground/background lifecycle, disconnect cleanup, and command serialization
   - multi-bed switching and whether one or several active connections are supported

8. Mandatory advanced-feature second pass
   - capability queries and feature bitmasks for motor count, memory count, lights,
     massage, PIN support, sensors, and model-specific feature exposure
   - authentication, PIN/password formats, pairing/bonding state, retries, lockouts,
     saved credentials, and when authentication gates control
   - firmware/OTA/DFU and bootloader paths, catalogued as out of scope unless they alter
     discovery, connection state, service selection, or normal command availability
   - device-information queries for model, manufacturer, serial, hardware, firmware,
     and protocol version, including how replies change later behavior
   - EEPROM/config/settings read and write paths, persistence, factory reset, calibration,
     save/restore, and any distinction from user memory-position programming
   - light behavior beyond on/off: brightness, RGB/color, automatic light, sensitivity,
     timeout, and under-bed or zone selection
   - dual/split/coupled behavior: left/right/A/B addressing, partner discovery, sync
     commands, mirrored movement, and independent capability selection
   - preset metadata: built-in versus user-defined names, custom labels, slot limits,
     save confirmation, long-press behavior, and per-model availability
   - position/status feedback: motor position, angle, height, percent, current, movement,
     calibration, invalid/sentinel values, and whether values are measured or estimated

Record NOT FOUND only after the corresponding structural, semantic, resource, and
callsite searches are present in SEARCH_LOG.md.

Phase E: Verify the reconstruction

1. Write small independent reproducer code for every packet builder, checksum/CRC, and
   parser complex enough to be mistranscribed.
2. Create concrete test vectors from the app. Each vector must include semantic action,
   input parameters, expected final bytes, and the source evidence that supplies it.
3. Validate at least two different frames for each checksum/CRC when two exist. Check
   every command constant against the builder and every dynamic field against multiple
   callsites or branches when available.
4. Re-run broad UUID, Bluetooth API, write/read/notify, byte-array, command, model, and
   timing searches after the first report draft. Reconcile every new hit with the
   candidate ledger.
5. Perform a reverse trace from every BLE write callsite back to its callers and a
   forward trace from every control action to a transport or explicit dead end.
6. Search for duplicate implementations, legacy paths, regional/product flavors,
   feature flags, reflection, dynamically loaded code, encrypted assets, and native
   indirection.
7. Confirm that report tables agree with the pseudocode, test vectors, and final bytes.
   If conflicting evidence remains, preserve both interpretations and mark unresolved.

EVIDENCE AND CONFIDENCE STANDARD

Every material claim must cite the shipped artifact with the strongest stable reference
available:

- Java/Kotlin: relative file, class, method, and line range
- smali: relative file, method signature, and instruction/label range
- Dart/Blutter: object/function identity, assembly or object-pool file, and address/line
- JavaScript/source map: original source path, function, and generated bundle reference
- native: library, architecture, symbol or virtual address, and relevant cross-reference
- resources: split/archive, resource path and key
- manifest: APK/split and exact component, permission, metadata, or intent-filter entry

Use exactly these confidence labels:

- VERIFIED: direct reachable code and final transport behavior are fully traced
- CORROBORATED: supported by at least two independent artifact references
- INFERRED: strongly implied, but one transformation or runtime choice is not provable
- TENTATIVE: plausible lead with material ambiguity
- NOT FOUND: exhaustive searches were recorded and produced no evidence
- BLOCKED: tooling, obfuscation, encryption, missing delivery data, or native code prevents
  a reliable conclusion

Do not upgrade confidence because a value looks familiar. Static analysis proves app
behavior, not physical hardware behavior. Clearly identify anything that requires a BLE
capture or hardware test.

REQUIRED OUTPUTS

The workspace is laid out as `input/` (supplied artifact, identity manifest, this prompt, schema),
`work/` (all decompiler and tool output) and `report/` (everything below). Write all outputs under
"<<WORKSPACE>>"/report/ and nowhere else. In a sharded run, substitute the shard's own
`report/<SHARD_ID>/` for `report/` throughout, per the complexity checkpoint above.

1. ANALYSIS.md, the human-readable forensic report, with these sections:
   - Identity, hashes, signer, source, and analysis status
   - Executive summary and explicit blockers
   - Artifact inventory and tool-coverage table
   - In-scope and out-of-scope functionality
   - Candidate ledger with reachability dispositions
   - Protocol/variant index
   - Discovery and protocol-selection matrix
   - GATT table and connection/session sequence
   - Packet formats, checksum/encryption algorithms, and reproducible pseudocode
   - Exhaustive command table
   - Notification/parser table
   - Timing, lifecycle, STOP, retry, and multi-device behavior
   - Capability, model, remote-code, and feature-selection matrix
   - Test vectors
   - Evidence index
   - Unresolved questions and exact hardware/log validation requests
   - Completeness checklist with PASS/FAIL for every gate below

2. analysis.json, a machine-readable equivalent for later matrix construction. It must
   validate against the supplied versioned JSON Schema and record that schema revision. It
   must contain identity, input hashes, status, stacks, tool coverage, candidates, protocols,
   variants, discovery rules, GATT roles, session sequence, packet formats, commands,
   notifications, capabilities, model mappings, test vectors, evidence, blockers, and
   validation requests. Do not omit a field merely because it was not found: report an
   unknown as null and put the explanation in the sibling `<field>_unknown_reason` string,
   for example `"commands": null` with `"commands_unknown_reason": "..."` stating what was
   searched. The schema rejects a bare null, so an exhaustively searched absence stays
   distinguishable from a section nobody examined.
   A run that stops at INPUT_MISMATCH may leave the identity hashes null and the stack
   inventory empty, since it is required to stop before establishing either.

3. SEARCH_LOG.md, an audit trail containing:
   - tool versions and exact commands
   - decompiler warnings and failed methods
   - search terms, regexes, directories/files searched, and result counts for every
     required search pass
   - newly discovered names fed back into follow-up searches and the point at which each
     search family produced no unexplained hits
   - every candidate protocol/class/builder and its disposition
   - fallbacks attempted and unresolved coverage gaps
   - a statement confirming that forbidden comparison sources were not accessed

4. Small reproducer/test-vector scripts used to verify builders, checksums, encryption,
   or parsers. Keep them package-local and reference them from ANALYSIS.md.

5. REPORT.SHA256 containing hashes of the final report, JSON, search log, and reproducer
   scripts. Create it only after the report passes review and is frozen.

COMPLETION GATES

Every gate below has a stable ID. `analysis.json` must carry one `completion_gates` entry per ID
with `gate`, `result` and `evidence`; the schema rejects a report that omits any of them. Mark the
run COMPLETE only when every gate passes:

- `identity_verified` — Input identity and all split hashes match the supplied manifest.
- `stack_coverage` — Every discovered application stack has successful analysis or an explicit
  blocker.
- `artifact_inventory` — All relevant splits, DEX files, resources, arrays, strings, assets,
  bundles, maps, SWFs, and native libraries were inventoried and inspected.
- `decompiler_warnings_resolved` — Every jadx warning or failed method with possible protocol
  relevance was resolved through context, smali, another stack-specific tool, or an explicit
  blocker.
- `search_passes_recorded` — Every required structural, API, data, action, capability, file-name,
  and logging search pass was recorded and has no unexplained result.
- `transport_callsites_dispositioned` — Every Bluetooth scan/connect/read/write/notify/descriptor
  callsite has a disposition.
- `protocol_candidates_dispositioned` — Every candidate protocol implementation/factory/model
  branch has a disposition.
- `control_actions_traced` — Every reachable control action is traced to final transport bytes or
  a documented runtime blocker.
- `command_rows_complete` — Every final command row has evidence, transport destination, timing,
  and STOP/release semantics.
- `test_vectors_reproducible` — Packet builders, checksums, parsers, and dynamic fields have
  reproducible test vectors.
- `feature_domains_searched` — Discovery, authentication, notifications, capabilities, model
  mapping, and lifecycle behavior were explicitly searched even when not found.
- `second_pass_clean` — The independent second-pass searches found no unexplained BLE or protocol
  hits.
- `variant_reconciliation` — For large product/model/variant catalogs, the deterministic inventory
  and every shard reconcile exactly: total equals analyzed plus evidence-backed
  aliases/duplicates, dead/unreachable, and blocked entries, with zero missing or double-counted
  entries.
- `schema_validation` — analysis.json validates against the supplied schema revision.
- `report_agreement` — ANALYSIS.md and analysis.json agree.
- `cleanroom_isolation` — No forbidden comparison source was accessed.
- `uncertainties_actionable` — Remaining uncertainties are specific and paired with an actionable
  capture or hardware test request.

Only `decompiler_warnings_resolved` (no decompiler produced a relevant warning) and
`variant_reconciliation` (the artifact has no multi-variant catalog to shard) may be reported
NOT_APPLICABLE in a COMPLETE run, and only with evidence for why the gate does not apply. Every
other gate must be PASS. If any gate fails, use PARTIAL or BLOCKED and explain exactly what
remains, with one exception: a failed `identity_verified` gate is reported as INPUT_MISMATCH, the
status Phase A step 1 requires. Do not downgrade that case to PARTIAL. PARTIAL asserts that the
artifact was analysed, and the schema holds it to populated stack and tool coverage and non-null
identity hashes, none of which a run that stopped at identity verification can honestly supply.
A precise partial report is better than a confident but unsupported complete report.
